# Bot-Typescript
This is a typescript discord bot made using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

 ### Installiation
If you wish to use this in this buggy state you will have to download it, then run npm i within the folder to download all the dependancies. After that you will have to make a .env folder with "DISCORD_TOKEN=<token>" in it.
Once you've downloaded all the dependancies you will have to compile the typescript to javascript, you can do that by running the command "npx tsc" while being in this folder.

after that is done you may configurate the settings to be as you wish, they are in the src/m/config.ts file.
